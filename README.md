# Hey-there
I'm Naomi, a beginner in programming, i'm eager and determined to learn more languages.
i never give up until i get stuff right. i get well with all kinds of people.
Like to have positive attitude. Hardwork does'nt bother me, i actually like it.
I like everything i do to be well organized. Organizing data so that it makes sense is rewarding for me and i'm also good at multitasking.
